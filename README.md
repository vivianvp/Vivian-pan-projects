## Choclolate Analysis ML
https://github.com/vivianvp/Vivian-pan-projects/blob/main/ML_Chocolate_Analysis.ipynb

Managers at companies often have to analyze sales performance to make strategic decisions that impact the sales, marketing, and HR departments. The impact of their decisions could potentially affect the company’s product portfolio, HR decisions, and marketing campaign focuses. In order to ensure their decisions are well educated, many companies perform detailed analysis on these sales reports.

I will simulate this analysis on an example data set that a chocolate selling company may have and give recommendations based on the analysis results.

Skills Showcased:
